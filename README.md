# The Little Robot Game

## Game Overview

This is a text-based adventure game. The player is a little robot who has crash-landed in a vast forest on a planet-sized wildlife preserve. A nearby village of park rangers have found the little robot, and the local blacksmith has brought it back to working condition.

In order to get back to space, the little robot will need help from the villagers. The village economy runs on a barter system, and are happy to trade resources in return for assistance from the little robot.

Eventually, the little robot will get access to the forest. There will be a new set of challenges here; the little robot will need to figure out how to get past various obstacles and appease hostile wildlife. There is no fighting in this game; all puzzles have a non-violent solution.

Once the ship is reached, chapter 3 happens. I don't know what happens in chapter 3.
